                  When to Book Your Wedding Limousine
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Westchester County is home to numerous stunning wedding venues, making it a popular wedding destination year-round. For peak wedding season (May through October), we recommend booking your limousine service 6-9 months in advance. Popular Saturdays at sought-after venues like The Castle at Tarrytown or Westchester Country Club book quickly, especially for luxury vehicles like stretch limousines and large Sprinter vans. Winter and early spring weddings offer more flexibility, with 3-4 months advance booking typically sufficient.

                  Creating Your Transportation Schedule
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Successful wedding day transportation requires careful timing. Start by mapping all locations: getting-ready venues, ceremony site, photo locations, and reception venue. Account for Westchester traffic patternsâ€”Saturday afternoon traffic on major routes like I-287 or the Hutchinson River Parkway can add 20-30 minutes to travel times. Build buffer time for photos, last-minute preparations, and unexpected delays. Most couples allocate vehicles for 6-8 hours to cover all wedding day transportation needs comfortably.

                  For couples seeking classic wedding transportation, stretch limousines remain the iconic choice. These vehicles accommodate 6-10 passengers comfortably, perfect for bridesmaids traveling together from getting-ready locations in Scarsdale or Harrison to ceremony sites. The extended interior provides ample space for wedding gowns, bouquets, and champagne toasts en route. White or black exterior options complement any wedding color scheme, and the elegant profile creates stunning photo opportunities at Westchester's beautiful venues.

                  Mercedes Sprinter vans have become increasingly popular for Westchester weddings, offering executive comfort combined with practical capacity. These vehicles seat up to 14 passengers with stand-up height, making them ideal for larger bridal parties or guest shuttle services between hotels and venues. Premium features include leather seating, ambient lighting, climate control, and entertainment systems. Sprinters work exceptionally well for transporting guests from Westchester hotels to ceremony and reception locations, ensuring everyone arrives together and on time.

                  Guest Shuttle Services for Westchester Weddings
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Many couples hosting destination-style weddings in Westchester provide shuttle transportation for out-of-town guests. This thoughtful service ensures guests staying at hotels in White Plains, Rye, or nearby areas can enjoy the celebration without worrying about navigation or parking. Shuttle services typically operate on a loop schedule, transporting guests from designated hotels to the ceremony/reception venue and returning them safely at the evening's conclusion. This approach also reduces parking congestion at venues and allows guests to celebrate without designated driver concerns.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Wedding limousine services in Westchester County typically offer hourly rates or package pricing. Most packages include a minimum rental period (often 4-6 hours), which covers essential wedding day transportation needs. Pricing factors include vehicle type, rental duration, date (peak season Saturdays command premium rates), and distance traveled. Many companies offer complete wedding packages that bundle bridal party transportation with guest shuttle services at discounted rates.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  When requesting quotes, provide detailed information about your timeline, guest count, and all pick-up/drop-off locations. Transparent pricing should include vehicle rental, chauffeur gratuity, fuel costs, and any applicable taxes. Some companies charge extra for services like red carpet rollout, champagne service, or decorative ribbonsâ€”clarify these details during booking to avoid surprises.

                  Beyond practical transportation, your wedding limousine becomes part of your celebration's memories.

The private moments in the limousineâ€”whether celebrating with your closest friends or enjoying quiet time as newlywedsâ€”become cherished memories captured by photographers and remembered for years to come.
