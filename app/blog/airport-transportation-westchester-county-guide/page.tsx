                  The key to stress-free airport transportation in Westchester County is advance booking. We recommend reserving your limousine service at least 24-48 hours before your flight, especially during peak travel seasons like holidays, summer vacation periods, and major business conference dates. Early booking ensures vehicle availability and allows our dispatch team to optimize routes and timing.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  One of the most valuable features of professional airport limousine service is real-time flight tracking. Our chauffeurs monitor your flight status from departure to arrival. If your flight is delayed, we adjust pickup times automatically—no need to call and reschedule. For early arrivals, your driver will be ready and waiting. This technology eliminates the guesswork and ensures punctual service regardless of airline schedules.

                  Safety and Licensing Requirements
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Professional airport transportation in New York State requires specific licensing and insurance coverage. All legitimate limousine services operating in Westchester County must maintain:
                </p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
                  <li>New York State Department of Transportation (DOT) operating authority</li>
                  <li>Commercial vehicle insurance with minimum $1.5 million liability coverage</li>
                  <li>Chauffeurs with valid NYS commercial driver's licenses</li>
                  <li>Regular vehicle safety inspections and maintenance records</li>
                  <li>Background checks and drug testing for all drivers</li>
                </ul>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  When booking airport transportation, always verify that your provider maintains proper licensing. This ensures passenger safety, vehicle reliability, and legal compliance—factors that distinguish professional limousine services from unlicensed operators.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Westchester County Airport (HPN) in White Plains offers unique advantages for local travelers. As a smaller, more manageable facility compared to JFK or Newark, HPN provides faster check-in, shorter security lines, and easier navigation. The airport serves major destinations through carriers including JetBlue, Delta, and American Airlines.

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  For residents of Westchester communities like Harrison, Mamaroneck, Larchmont, or Pelham, HPN is often the most convenient option, with typical drive times under 20 minutes. Our limousine service to Westchester County Airport includes the same professional amenities as our NYC airport transfers—flight monitoring, meet and greet service, and luxury vehicles—at competitive rates reflecting the shorter distance.

                  Seasonal Travel Tips for Airport Transportation
                </h2>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  Westchester County experiences distinct seasonal challenges that affect airport transportation timing and planning:
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  <strong>Winter (November-March):</strong> Snow and ice can significantly impact travel times from Westchester to NYC airports. During winter months, we recommend adding 30-45 minutes to standard travel times for flights departing JFK, LaGuardia, or Newark. Our chauffeurs monitor weather forecasts and road conditions, adjusting departure times proactively to ensure on-time arrivals despite challenging conditions.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  <strong>Summer (June-August):</strong> Peak vacation season means heavier traffic on I-95, Hutchinson River Parkway, and major airport access roads. Friday afternoons and Sunday evenings see particularly heavy congestion. Book morning or midday transfers when possible to avoid rush hour delays.
                </p>

                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  <strong>Holiday Periods:</strong> Thanksgiving, Christmas, and New Year's weeks represent the busiest travel periods. Vehicle availability can be limited, and prices may reflect premium demand. We strongly recommend booking holiday airport transfers 2-3 weeks in advance to secure your preferred vehicle and time slot.
